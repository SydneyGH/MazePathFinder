# MazePathFinder

This is an algorithm that will slove mazes with one start and end point.
The maze will have to be typed in order to solve different variations of mazes.
This is created by using BFS (Breadth First Search) to find the fastest pather to the endpoint of the maze.

An example of the code running is below:
